0,SIMS Hospital,Chennai,Sims is centrally located at Vadapalani. Has a good reputation. They have emergency ward and ambulance service is also available. Yesterday I went there to visit someone and urgently needed to use the toilet. The toilet was locked. I asked the young boy at the reception what to do. To my pleasant surprise he came with me and guided me to a toilet inside the premises. Even that toilet was locked. Then he called an attender and told him to take me to a toilet that was unlocked and my problem was solved. What I actually expected was a brush off. The care this boy took was a pleasant change. But every rose has a thorn and the parking area attendants are exactly that. They seem to have employed all middle aged fat unwieldy parking attendants. They are lazy and disrespectful. I am sure the boss of the agency supplying the parking attendants must be exactly like them. That is why this attitude. No use blaming the attendants. Owners of the hospital must talk to the agency that supplies the parking attendants. Give me a like if my review was helpful guys... have a great day ,2.499999978

0,DESUN Hospital And Heart Institute,Kolkata,This is an incident in the month of February 2019. First of all the doctors are pretty pathetic and will try to extract as much as money as possible from the patient by getting them emotionally weak or rather blackmailing them. So if you want to burn a hole in your pocket and get your patient deteriorated this is the best possible option.They will also get tons of tests done (which has very less significance with respect to the proper diagnosis required ) just to extract money. You dont even get a D of Diagnosis.My grandma went in in a condition and went out much worse than what she was before. Overall this is a much hyped place and the name drives it. If you have the option of any other hospital please chalk this out of the list. This will not only save money but also save the patient,-1.199999936
0,Fortis Hospital,Kolkata,I had an appointment with one of the senior cardiologist. My appointment was at 1120 AM. I reached the place well in advance by 1045 AM to complete the formalities. Once all forms were filled along with payment it was informed that Doctor will be available by 1230 PM. It seems the usual norm is there is no fixed appointment schedule. If you want to meet your desired doctor then come in the morning wait till you are lucky. Next day was test which went well without any hassle. Third day was doctors consultation with the report. Again our appointment was at 345 PM. This time we came by 300 PM. but it seems we were too late. For a 345 PM appointment the expectation is to reach by 1230 PM. This was confirmed by the receptionist who had no idea when the doctor is going to arrive. Luckily I got my office laptop and finished half of my work sitting in the waiting area. The doc finally arrived by 600 PM. There was another instance where one patient who came for an appointment and was not informed that the doctor was on leave.

0,Govind Ballabh Pant Hospital,Delhi,Lets walk through a 5step process for building a paragraph. For each step there is an explanation and example. Our example paragraph will be about slave spirituals the original songs that African Americans created during slavery. The model paragraph uses illustration (giving examples) to prove its point.Step 1. Decide on a controlling idea and create a topic sentenceParagraph development begins with the formulation of the controlling idea. This idea directs the paragraphs development. Often the controlling idea of a paragraph will appear in the form of a topic sentence. In some cases you may need more than one sentence to express a paragraphs controlling idea. Here is the controlling idea for our model paragraph expressed in a topic sentenceModel controlling idea and topic sentence   Slave spirituals often had hidden double meanings.Step 2. Explain the controlling ideaParagraph development continues with an expression of the rationale or the explanation that the writer gives for how the reader should interpret the information presented in the idea statement or topic sentence of the paragraph. The writer explains hisher thinking about the main topic idea or focus of the paragraph. Heres the sentence that would follow the controlling idea about slave spiritualsModel explanation  On one level spirituals referenced heaven Jesus and the soul but on another level the songs spoke about slave resistance.,-1.300000027

0,Apollo Speciality Hospitals,Chennai,Quick response good behaviour helping natures but treatment is not good because after surgery senior doctors give responsibility to learning doctors i.e. junior doctors.

They really dont know the function of medicines or intravenous injection which are given to patients. Because of all these patients get serious or died even after the successful surgery.

After reaching there the receptionist simply said the machines were all down it was rather shocking and unbelievable for such a big hospital to have machines not running and all down and the worst thing was they didnt even bother to call back and informed about there machines situation. Id have no issues if they would have call back at least as it is difficult to arrange a day and travelled so far when you are a working person.

0,Command Hospital,Kolkata,As this is free service the doctors provide worst service. Either doctors are incapable or they are negligent.

0,Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital,Chennai,My mother in law admitted in the hospital. 3days she has died because of worst treatment from duty doctors under Dr. Vasanthi team. She is never seeing the patients. Also Dr. Jessy the worst doctor in the hospital. Also if they are putting you in ward 206 then it shows they will not take care of patients and leads to death.Better take to kmc or multi speciality for better treatment.,-3.300000012
0,Apollo Spectra Hospitals,Delhi,The entire staff reacts too slow except the security guards. There was no benefit for prior appointments as I had booked it 3 days prior to the appointment date for my family health checkup including me. People on reception were less knowledgeable and more on shouting amongst themselves for very small reasons. The Dr. came too late and when enquired at reception they said he was busy in OT. Anyhow the Dr. came and sounded good though. Very poor management I observed.,-3.899999976
0,Sant Parmanand Hospital,Delhi,Hospital reception response is the worst. No sense of management. Thyroid doctor appointment is only for two hours Monday and Thursday. Doctors rush to leave the patients hanging without proper check as their time is up. No sense of professionalism in staff or doctors. Overall it is expensive time waste and one is never satisfied with consulation.,-4.099999964

0,Dr. Mehta's Hospitals,Chennai,It is a really unprofessional place. Argumentative staff. And moreover the staff was very rude. (EMERGENCY WARD). The doctors were ok. But the other staff really pushed the limits. We asked for some hot water for the hot water bag and the refused They added things to the bill without information. And argued back when enquired about it. The IV they put in the hand was so painful they put it in and took it out several times saying that they couldnt locate the vein. Long story short I would never recommend this place to anyone.,-4.299999952
0,Kalra Hospital,Delhi,Worst Hospital ever visited. Highly unsatisfactory treatment with useless charges included. Youd be given a whole lot of medicines without your consent or knowledge or any need. My sister was admitted in this hospital for a minor accident and that too in ICU for 2 days. On the first day of admission Xray report showed that there was no major injury still they took an extra day to shift my sister. And that was because we denied to pay any other single day in ICU. So they shifted my sister to normal ward. But that was not the end. Even in the normal ward in there was no injury then why did they asked us make my sister stay in hospital. Somehow we made them discharge her.Overall Worst experience,-4.499999978
0,The Calcutta Medical Research Institute,Kolkata,The worst hospital possible. Nurses and staff are totally untrained and have no worry about patient problems. Being in an executive room they forgot that the patient needs food. No food was given to the patient on the day of admission. Nurses again forgot the Dr. has advised discharge. Then they had one person to collect all discharge payments. After an hour of waiting they informed us that they havent received the payment. No point getting any person admitted here even if you know the doctor.,-4.599999979
0,Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial Hospital,Kolkata,Doctors have good degrees but very rude behaviour. Nurse and sisters are just a mess. No care of the patient. Very bad place.CCU which should have the best service has the worst one. Very bad place.Patient experiences new symptoms here. Bedsore is common here as the staff is nonsense here. Bribe is famous here. Give money and everything is done all rules broken. But if we give money to sisters the fools will accept money but not take care of the patient.The staff is a nonsense here.,-5.49999994
0,Primus Super Speciality Hospital,Delhi,i wud never recommend this hospital to anyone especially during emergency.  it happened nearly few days agoi was in desperate need for first aid as my hand got cut from iron slider. since primus hospital is quite nearby to our embassy me and husband went . As we entered the entry gate in the morning we were stopped by this paid parking man with moustache from SAI authority . IHe asked for the parking charges to which we agreed to pay. since i was bleeding heavily  i tried to ran fast to get the first aid in emergency and asked my husband to pay him the parking charges. but to my surprise he stopped me and kept me waiting along with my husband for nearly 1520 mins. i was nearly about to faint and requested him to do the formalities asap but he was unaffected and very short tempered man.  fortunately 1 staff member came to my rescue and asked the parking guy to make it fast as he can . you know what guys?  he literally shouted on that staff and argued with him.  i was in tears and embarrassed too  also heard that he was abusing foreign visitors although i cudnt understyand his language but it seems he was not happy with foreign visitors.  me and my husband left as soon as possible as we felt insulted. we swore that never ever we are coming back also will ask embassy to depanel them. where a parking guy dont respect his own staff then how can we expect any respect from him.,-6.600000009
0,"Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket (Max Saket)",Delhi,Very expensive. They charge you unnecessarily. The doctors in the opd doesnt care to ask your real problems. Will quickly give you 23 medicines and ask you to go. The fees is too high. I went there twice. Both the times it was a bad experience. My friend was suffering from cold and fever. When we took her to this hospital they gave her a bill of 7000. The campus is huge but the area they have put up in is really congested. I have seen The ambulances of this hospital getting stuck in the horrible traffic. Its looks more like a 5 star hotel than a hospital. They only care about the money. They will give you all sorts of unnecessary tests to be done. The staff here is also not polite. Not helpful at all. They prefer to have no conversation at all. Absolutely a disappointing hospital.,-7.000000052
